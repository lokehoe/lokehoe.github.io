<p style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:150%;color:yellow">Universal Studios Singapore
<p style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:120%">Universal Studios Singapore is a theme park located within Resorts World Sentosa on Sentosa Island, Singapore.

Construction of the theme park and the rest of the resort started on 19 April 2007. It is the second Universal Studios theme park to open in Asia (Japan being the first), and the first in Southeast Asia. The official plans for the park were unveiled to the public when Universal Studios Singapore released a park map to the public on 20 October 2009. Universal Studios Singapore has since attracted more than 2 million visitors in the 9 months from its opening.<img src="universal.jpg"height=150 width=150 border=6 alt="universal.jpg" align=right><br>

The park was first designed as an emblem for the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in 1964 and on 15 September 1972, the park was officially opened at an installation ceremony of the statue, officiated by then Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. The original statue of the Merlion used to stand at the mouth of the Singapore River. The statue was made from November 1971 to August 1972 by the late Singapore sculptor, Mr Lim Nang Seng, it measures 8.6 metres high and weighs 70 tons. Upon the completion of Esplanade Bridge, the view of the statue was blocked from the Marina Bay Waterfront.
