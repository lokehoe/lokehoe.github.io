<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn-wG4Uy6mE" target="_blank">Cambridge Assessment International Education - A Level</a>
<p style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:120%">The Cambridge A Level has remained a favourite among many SPM & IGCSE holders for many reasons. One important reason is its GLOBAL RECOGNITION by top universities around the world such as:<br><br>
- Ivy League universities in the US (e.g. Harvard, MIT, etc.)
- Russell Group universities in the UK (e.g. Cambridge, Oxford, LSE, Imperial, UCL, etc.)
- Group of Eight universities in Australia (e.g. ANU, Melbourne, Sydney, etc.)
<br><br>
Like many, their motivations may not be to get into these top universities but they feel ‘safe’ doing A Level because it is recognized by many universities in Malaysia and overseas. They also feel happy because A Level gives them more choices of universities to choose from.
<br><br>
For the adventurous, A Level opens the door to FREE tertiary education in Germany & you can enroll in an (English-taught) engineering course which is mostly offered by University of Applied Sciences there. It costs about RM50k a year to cover flight tickets & cost of living in Germany. Click for more info: (1) A Level student getting offers & (2) Talk by DAAD on Studying in Germany.  
<br><br>
Whichever path you wish to take, speak to us to plan the right combination of A Level subjects.<br><br>

<p style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:150%;color:yellow">About Foundation in Business (FIB)</p>
<p style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:120%">Leveraging on our 20 years of experience in teaching A Level, the college created FIB for the following reasons:<br>
 1. A 1-year university foundation to ‘bridge’ students to degree studies in Law, Accounting, & Finance, Management, Marketing, Economics and other social science disciplines (e.g. Psychology, Political Science, etc).<br>
2. A university foundation which gives more options to students, i.e. not only recognised at Crescendo, but more importantly by colleges & universities in Malaysia and overseas.<br>
3. A programme in which students are continuously assessed (i.e. not a one-time final exam) using a mixed mode of progress test, presentation, assignment and a final exam.<br>
<p style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:150%;color:yellow">Recognition</p>
<p style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:120%">FIB is recognised by the University of London (UOL) for entry into its degree programmes such as Law, Accounting & Finance, Business & Management, Economics and many others. The University of London degrees are conducted in Recognised Teaching Centres in various cities in Malaysia (e.g. JB, & KL) and around the world (e.g. in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, etc). Find out more about UOL Recognised Teaching Centres here. </p> 
<p style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:120%">The FIB, with its MQA approval, is also recognised by public universities for some of their programmes (e,g, UTM for its International degree programme) and private universities in Malaysia.
